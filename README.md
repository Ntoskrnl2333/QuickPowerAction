This is a project for Windows NT series to have a quick power action, such as shutdown, reboot, hibernate and sleep.

You can use it when your computer can't shutdown/reboot/hibernate/sleep in some reason. 

It only support Simplified Chinese, welcome to help me make it support other languages.

Bugs:
1. When you only choose shutdown,reboot or sleep but you don't choose the operation method or the sleeping depth, it should give you a message box, but you can only listen the sound.
2. If you choose a sleeping depth which your computer doesn't support it, it will hibernate. But this is Microsoft's problem.
